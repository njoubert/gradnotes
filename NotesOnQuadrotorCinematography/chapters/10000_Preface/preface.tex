Research in Computer Science is a challening and potentially rewarding blend of:
\begin{itemize}
\item project management
\item reading and learning
\item thinking
\item problem-solving
\item experimentation
\item mathematical modeling
\item engineering systems
\item psychology studies
\item writing
\item public discourse in the form of public speaking and argueing
\item people management and collaboration skill
\end{itemize}
Becoming uncommonly good in all of these areas will serve you well during and after your Ph.D studies.
