\chapter{Questions I'd Like To Know The Answer To}

There are many areas, both explored and new, that I'd like to understand thoroughly. It seems to me like the best way to do that is through asking questions. Questions are both the end-product and raw fuel of curiosity, so I'm yotting the questions I do not have a satisfying answer to here.

This section is truly intended for myself, and many a reader might find themselves either bored or stunned by my apparent ignorance. For that I apologize, I am in no way knowleadgable about everything I need to be, even less what I want to be. If you have an intuitive answer to these, please to email me a niels@cs.stanford.edu
